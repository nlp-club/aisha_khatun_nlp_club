# aisha_khatun_nlp_club
A repo to track updates in nlp_club activities from my end. slack: @aisha khatun

N.B These resources are taken from the channel #sg_deepdive-nlp and arranged according my plan for covering them.

#### trello: https://trello.com/b/lYQwQojM/udacity-nlp-with-pytorch

## Resources :
- Siraj Raval's NLP curriculum (https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn-Natural-Language-Processing-Curriculum)
- fast.ai (https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/)
- stanford: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
- implementing BERT / XL Net in Kaggle projects
- Learn to use RNN for sentiment analysis -- https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188
       - Lesson 7 - Recurrent Neural Network
       - Lesson 8 - Sentiment Prediction RNN
- Kaggle competition - Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification : https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification -- With this dataset, we can learn to apply various techniques, including pre-processing, feature engineering, RNN, BERT, XLNet 
- Read papers about the latest development in BERT and XLNet and learn how to apply them (overlaps with #2, but with a specific BERT and XLNet focus and not necessarily using the toxic language dataset)

## Books:
- Beginners book (brushup?) : NLP with python, spacy documentation.

## Good reads:
- Marianna Janczak [2:01 PM] : I've just read a great article about the use of RNNs in text generation. Take a look: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
- Aniket Mitra 11:59 AM https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/8-free-resources-for-beginners-to-learn-natural-language-processing/   keep these resources with you. They are the most popular and best lectures in NLP. After you finish fast.ai course and manage to get some time, you can start going through them.:smiley:
- Droid:male-technologist: 8:28 PM
A few sentiment analysis notebooks using pytorch, figured might help someone out :smile:

## Codes
- Agata [OR, USA] 3:27 PM
[Kaggle kernels related to NLP] https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?sortBy=relevance&group=everyone&search=NLP&page=1&pageSize=20

## Dataset
https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets

## Chosen(plus plan):
- fastai
- next, learning BERT and XL NET plus kaggle competition
